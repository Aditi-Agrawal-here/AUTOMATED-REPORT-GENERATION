About This Project:

This project focuses on automating the generation of a structured weather analysis report using data stored in weather_data.csv. The script reads weather details, analyzes key parameters like temperature, humidity, and wind speed, and compiles insights into a formatted PDF report using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and FPDF.

Key Features:

1) Reads weather data from weather_data.csv.
2) Analyzes temperature, humidity, and wind speed trends.
3) Identifies hottest and coldest cities based on temperature.
4) Generates bar and pie charts for visualization.
5) Creates a well-structured PDF report with weather insights.

How It Works:

Read Data – The script loads weather data from weather_data.csv.
Analyze Data – Computes average temperature, humidity, wind speed, and identifies extreme conditions.
Generate Visuals – Creates bar charts for temperature and humidity trends and a pie chart for weather condition distribution.
Export Report – Compiles all insights into a PDF report with graphical representations.

Technologies Used:

1) Python
2) Pandas (for data analysis)
3) Matplotlib (for visualization)
4) FPDF (for PDF generation)

Installation and Usage:

1) Ensure weather_data.csv is present in the project folder.
2) Install required libraries:
   pip install pandas matplotlib fpdf
3) Run the script:
   python generate_report.py

Check the output:

Bar Chart: Temperature and humidity distribution.
Pie Chart: Weather condition distribution.
PDF Report: Final formatted weather analysis report.

Output Files:

weather_data.csv – Contains processed weather data.
temp_humidity_chart.png – Bar chart for temperature and humidity.
weather_condition_chart.png – Pie chart for weather condition distribution.
Weather_Report.pdf – Final generated report.

Challenges Faced and Learnings:

Handling missing or inconsistent weather data.
Choosing the best data representation for analysis.
Formatting a structured and readable PDF report.
Automating the entire workflow from data processing to report generation.

Conclusion:

This project provided practical experience in data processing, visualization, and automated report generation. The use of Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and FPDF helped create an efficient and professional weather report generation system.
